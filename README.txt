Naive Bayes is among one of the very simple and powerful algorithms for classification based on Bayes Theorem with an assumption of independence among the predictors. The Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a feature in a class is not related to any other feature. Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary and multi-class classification problems.

About dataset:

Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
